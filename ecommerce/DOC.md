### Widgets vs Helper Methods

> Use separate widgets instead of helper methods

- Calling setState within a widget reruns its entire build method
- Rendering an icon in a helper method requires rebuilding the entire wrapping widget

- ResponsiveSliverCenter
- ResponsiveTwoCloumnLayout
- ResponsiveScrollableCard
